# This JA3-hash is a fingerprint for connections originating
# from FortiGate devices that support all encryption and
# hashing algorithms for doing TLS.

# Whereas the far majority of TLS-connections use different
# parameters, the built-in logging functionality of FortiGate
# devices seems to make use of identical TLS-parameters,
# leading to potential false positive results from this JA3
# hash.

# Therefore, traffic should be judged as legitimate (i.e., as
# false positive indicator of COATHANGER) if it originates
# from a FortiGate device and has:
# − port 541 or 514 as destination port and
# − an IP address belonging to Fortinet Inc. or a Fortinet
# device, such as a FortiManager as destination.
